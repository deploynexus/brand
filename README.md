## prose

### headings
Headings should preferably be all lowercase and as short as possible. However, if following one (or both) of those guidelines isn't possible, don't worry about it. Headings should follow the natural flow of content; making use of heading tags properly. `h1` or `#` should be used once per document or once per subject (whichever is greater). `h2` or `##` should be used to represent different sections of a document or subject. `h3` or `###` can be used with more freedom but should still represent a heading of some sort. The rest of the levels, 4 through 6, have no specific guidelines.

### dashes
I'm a stickler for using proper dashes. By that logic, please use hyphens <kbd>-</kbd>, en-dashes <kbd>&ndash;</kbd>, and em-dashes <kbd>&mdash;</kbd> where applicable. Em-dashes are preferred over semicolons, unless the blocking nature of a semicolon is beneficial to the content.

### rendering
Attempt to pretty print wherever possible. For example, render `code` with backticks&mdash;and in the case of a code block, a language too. Render math with $\text{latex}$. Use HTML tags such as `<kbd/>` to overcome Markdown's limitations when drawing attention to content that can't be adequately highlighted with bold or italicized text.
